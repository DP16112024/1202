# Diabetes Logistic Regression Analysis

## Project Description
This project demonstrates a Logistic Regression analysis using Python, applied to a dataset related to diabetes diagnostics. The analysis is structured to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on given medical features.

## Contents
- **Notebook**: `Week5a-LogReg-Example (2).ipynb` – Contains the implementation of Logistic Regression, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
- **Dataset**: `diabetes.csv` – A dataset with medical diagnostic measurements and a target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.
